      <h2>Stereotype Threat - My Personal Experience</h2>
      <h4>October, 26th of 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>This week's cultural blog post is about a very interesting subject, stereotype threat. As a way of contextualizing my post I will start by sharing with you a short definition of what stereotype threat is.</p>
      <p><span id="quote">"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group".</span> Steele CM., Aronson J.,<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7473032">1995.</a> More <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/">here</a> and a really interesting lecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Researching about this subject has been really interesting. First, because it has made me think about my own experience and how there might have been moments in my life when I have been subject of stereotype threat.</p>
      <p>I can picture one particular moment when I've felt this way. I am a Physical Therapist and I worked for three years at a public hospital in Santiago, Chile. About two years ago I got transfered to the general medicine unit of the hospital, one of my patients there was a man about 60 years old with a severe condition that had greatly diminished his ability to move independently. He would often make comments about the staff in that unit being too young and inexperienced. This made me feel nervous and doubtful of my own skills, I felt like I was being constantly judged by him because of my age and that he didn't really believe in my advice and the therapy I was suggesting for him.</p>
      <p>At first, this made me doubt my skills and lose focus during the therapy sessions, making mistakes and having to repeat my instructions continuously trying to correct myself. With time I was able to gain confidence and gain his trust, this improved my performance and the effectiveness of the therapy.</p>
      <p>Recalling this experience has made me realize that there might be times in everyday life when simple gestures or comments might trigger this feeling in others and that being aware of your context and your behavior might have a big impact on creating a good environment for everyone to feel and ultimately perform better.</p>
