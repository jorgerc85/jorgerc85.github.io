      <h2>Feedback - An ongoing learning experience</h2>
      <h4>October, 19th of 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>Pairing has been a really good experience for me, both technically and culturally. On the technical side, I've been able to see other people's thought process and different approaches and techniques. Pairing with more knowledgeable people has also allowed me to understand new concepts and solidify other concepts that were still not 100% acquired.</p>
      <p>Culturally, pairing has allowed me to feel exchange experiences with other boots and feel part of a community of people going through a common process.</p>
      <p>I would say that in general pairing is fun, it is challenging to speak up your ideas when you're not completely sure about them but as time goes by it gets easier. Having your pair to listen and give you feedback on your ideas is also something I value about pairing.</p>
      <p>There have been really good, fun and rewarding moments during pairing. The feeling of figuring out a solution or finding that one method that solves everything for you is great and it feels even better when you are in the same boat with someone else. Reading "6 examples, 0 failures" and sharing that with your partner is awesome!</p>
      <p>Feeling comfortable about giving input or suggesting a different path is not always easy for me, this is something that has changed since the beginning and I feel more comfortable now than then.</p>
      <p>I would say that the most frustrating moment is when you think you have an answer and the tests still fail. That feeling of hitting your head against a wall is discouraging but it feels better to know that you are not alone. Being able to joke about it and keeping a good sense of humor when failing at solving a problem gives you a mental break and allows you to get out of that negative mentality.</p>
      <p>Feedback related experiences have been good, a learning experience. Receiving feedback is interesting. Getting to know other people's perspective on a pairing session complements the feedback you receive directly from them during the session. Most of the time you get a better worded version of that original feedback that comments on some specific moments of the session and why those moments were important to that person. This is really good because it helps you focus on your behavior in certain situations and not just a general opinion of how good or bad you were during that session.</p>
      <p>I would say that in general the feedback I've received has been useful, it has helped me to focus on my weakest points and has also made me feel more confident about certain things I wasn't sure I was doing well. For example, I know I have to be more confident about communicating my ideas, I also should improve in my use of pseudocode. I'm trying to improve both of this skills session by session and receiving feedback reminds me to focus on them during sessions.</p>
      <p>Writing feedback has been a diverse experience. Sometimes it's challenging to condensate over one hour of interaction in just a few paragraphs, sometimes feedback just flows out and it is really easy. Over time, I would say that giving feedback is something that you have to get used to. Being actionable and specific is not as easy as it sounds when you feel that the session was good or better, you have to search deep inside to find something that you think is worth saying and that could be helpful for your pair to improve. Being kind when giving any sort of feedback has been difficult a couple of times but I feel it is something that takes time to get used to and master.</p>
      <p>Overall, I really like the pairing/feedback dynamic. It is definitely a work in progress and there is always room for improving but the more we do it, the more we'll learn. I think that this workflow is key for the online part of DBC to be successful and it will definitely be the foundation of our skills to engage in person to person pairing once the immersive part of our course begins.</p>
