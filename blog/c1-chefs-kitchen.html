  <h2>My Take on the DBC experience - Step into the kitchen</h2>
  <h4>September 20th, 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
  <p>I just finished watching an introductory video about DevBootcamp by Shereef Bishay and I have to say that most of what he talked about in the video resonated with me. Starting with how DBC began all the way to the philosophy behind DBC, and how it has evolved throughout time, the story of behind DBC makes me feel more convinced than ever that I made the right decision signing up.<br><br>The idea that this program is more about exploring than sitting in a series of lectures taking information in, that the experience should resemble a playground, or a kitchen as he puts it, is very comforting to me. I think that learning, for most hands-on disciplines at least, should be all about this. Jumping into a new subject ready to test, experiment and find the answers through that experience is key to establish solid knowledge that you will be able to apply and adapt to new challenges along your way.<br><br>Personally, I feel like this is the kind of place I've been wanting to be in my whole life. I'm a physical therapist but I'm also a tinkerer by nature, I've opened and fixed laptops, I've built a bicycle, which I still use and do maintenance to. This curiosity has lead me to programming in the first place. I've tried to teach myself for a few months but I've come to realize that I need a proper environment to learn if I want to have a solid understanding of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. I think that an environment like DBC will really benefit me.<br><br>As Shereef said in the video, your experience at DBC depends on what you bring into it. I believe that to be true in all aspects of life. Hopefully, I will be able to contribute to DBC in a way that maximizes my experience and everyone else's.</p>
