      <h2>Tech Issues - Diversity in the Tech Industry</h2>
      <h4>October, 12th of 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>
        The tech industry is constantly growing and expanding, pushing innovation and creating new opportunities for people to connect, create and solve issues. But who is directing and participating in the development of this industry? Who is helping shape the future of the industry? Is there a balance in the makeup of the industry? Studies say no and I will try to point out why I think that balance is an important goal and how it could be achieved.<br><br>Society is more than the sum of all its members, it's a mix of their experiences, perspectives, hopes and fears. In an ideal society, all of this aspects should be considered when making decisions about the future and how we want to coexist and live. We certainly can not make everyone happy and do what everyone wants but we can listen to each other and compromise in a way that benefits the most of us.<br><br>Given how technology is increasingly shaping our society and the way we all connect and interact, the decisions being made about how to move forward take on a fundamental role and should, just like in an ideal society, represent what we all hope for the future.<br><br>Researches show that diversity is not a characteristic that can describe the tech industry, white males make up for most of the employees in every company and all minorities, females, black people, Asians, Latinos and others, are under represented in the overall makeup of the industry. This is specially true when talking about leadership positions, where the numbers of people representing minorities go even lower.<br><br>Even though this is a reality in many levels and areas of our society, being politics the most important of them, the tech industry should encourage diversity. This will help making the industry better at reading the users needs, understanding their needs and adapting to changes. Just like a tree is stronger when its roots go deeper and range wider, the tech industry should be based on a diverse representation of society.<br><br>In order to achieve this, many factors have to be considered. Access to technology for kids can increase their curiosity and their desires to pursue a career in the industry. Educational institutions could encourage diversity in their programs with scholarships. Tech companies could set programs to increase the ratio of members of their staff representing minorities.<br><br>Diversity in the tech industry is a complex issue, it is part of a bigger issue that exists in our society but it can be improved with different measures at different levels. If everyone helps with a little part, the sum of all efforts will show results, just like in an ideal society.
