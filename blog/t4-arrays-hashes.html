      <h2>Arrays and Hashes - Organizing Information</h2>
      <h4>October 5th, 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>
        Storing, organizing and accessing information is a key feature of computers, knowing that you can input data into a computer, store it in an structured manner and then access it at will has changed information management for good. Data structures are how we organize this information and this week we will cover two types of them, Arrays and Hashes.<br><br>Ruby incorporates this two data structures and depending on the task that we face we will prefer using one or the other. Hopefully this post will help us understand why, when and how to use both of them.<br><br>Arrays are like lists of elements, they can hold words ("Strings"), numbers("Integers") or even other lists inside them. This gives them great flexibility. Imagine an inventory list, it has many elements in it with one element per slot and you can find what's stored in that slot by searching for that slot's number. Arrays are similar, they are structured like this:<br><br><span>array_1 = (element_1, element_2, element_3, ..., element_n)</span><br><br>And you can access the information inside it by calling the index of the corresponding slot like this:<br><br><span>array_1[<span>1</span>] ---> And its output would be <span><span>element_2</span></span></span><br><br>No, I didn't make a mistake there, that one was on purpose. In Ruby as in many other languages, the first element of a list is the "zeroth" element. In this case the first element of the list would be <span>element_1</span> and its index would be <span>0</span>.<br><br>If, on the other hand, you wanted to see in which position of the list <span>element_3</span> is, you would type in something like this:<br><br><span>array_1.at(2) ---> This will output <span><span>element_3</span></span></span><br><br>Hashes on the other side, have a different structure, they can also hold different types of elements, including both arrays and other hashes but the way in which they keep the information in order is different. Imagine a dictionary, its structure allows you to find one element and, connected to it, a second element. Hashes are similar, their structure allows you to list elements in pairs (keys and values), like this:<br><br><span>hash_1 = { element_1 <span>=> element_a</span>, element_2 <span>=> element_b</span>, ..., element_n <span>=> element_x</span> }</span><br><br>Here <span>element_1</span> would be the key, linked to it, <span><span>element_a</span></span> would be the value. Where hashes differ from dictionaries is that you can call its elements in whichever order you prefer. For example, if you want to find out the element associated with <span>element_1</span>, you would do this:<br><br><span>hash_1[element_1] --->	This would output <span><span>element_a</span></span></span><br><br>In the same way, if you wanted to find out the element associated with <span><span>element_b</span></span>, you would do this:<br><br><span>hash_1.key(<span><span>element_b</span></span>) ---> This would output <span>element_2</span></span><br><br>From this two main characteristics you can see that both arrays and hashes have different capabilities. Both are flexible in terms of what type of elements they can hold but they differ when it comes to how they handle the information that we store in them.<br><br>If you think that you need a list like structure, where you can store elements and be able to access them quickly or figure out in which position they are inside the list, then arrays might be the way to go. If you want to relate elements like in a dictionary and be able to find an element and the element associated to it, then a hash might be the best approach for you.
