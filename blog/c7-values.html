      <h2>Values</h2>
      <h4>November, 2nd of 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>On this week's blog post I will share with you certain values that have been important for me throughout my life. One way or another this values represent my biggest struggles but also my greatest accomplishments</p>
      <p>Adventure, Challenge, Growth, Openness and Persistence.</p>
      <p>I put them together because they represent, in one way or another, the challenge of getting out of my comfort zone. To push myself out there and do something that is, new and hard for me to do. Most of the time, this leads to a growth experience that takes persistence but that also has ended in some of the happiest and most satisfactory moments of my life.</p>
      <p>Using this scale, do I try to live up to this values?<br><br>
      Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree<br><br>
      Adventure 3.<br>
      Challenge 3.<br>
      Growth 3.<br>
      Openness 3.<br>
      Persistence 3.</p>
      <p>As I said, this is a struggle for me. I go through this cycle over and over again. I always find a comfort zone and I always push myself out from it to find something new, something that challenges me to be what I haven't been able to be before, to be a better person, to be a happier person.</p>
      <p>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</p>
      <p>People don't use to ask me for advice directly, normally I have conversations with people and they seem to feel comfortable enough to tell me about their problems. I listen and bounce ideas to them and try to get them to see other possibilities and points of view. I would say that a regular subject is human relationships in general.</p>
      <p>Values and Stereotype threat</p>
      <p>I think that, whether you recognize that you are feeling stereotype threat or not, your values are a good place to set a stance and face whatever you have in front.</p>
      <p>Something that always helps me when I'm feeling down is to interact with people, to try to get out of my problems and see that there is so much more in this life that one particular situation or problem.</p>
