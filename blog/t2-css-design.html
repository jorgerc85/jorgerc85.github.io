      <h2>CSS Positioning: Relative, absolute, and fixed - What, when, and how</h2>
      <h4>September 28th, 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>There is a saying that goes: "Location, location, location...", it refers to real state and how to determine the value of a property. Even though <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/magazine/28FOB-onlanguage-t.html">some controversy</a> exists as to who coined this phase, it still reflects the importance of what we'll be talking about today.</p>
      <p>Element positioning is very important when creating a website, it can make or break the way your site looks and you should always keep that in mind when adding new elements to your site. CSS has a few ways of handling element positioning, we will go over them in this article an hopefully we will all understand it better after we are done. Read on!</p>
      <p>CSS allows us to set the HTML elements' position by setting their position properties. This properties are 4: Static, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed. The first one, Static, is the default property of all HTML objects that are created and it will set the elements in one place of the page and keep them there.</p>
      <p>The second one, Relative, is set when you want to position an element in relation to how it would have been set in the first place. Trying to be more clear, an object that has been set to 'relative' moves having its original position as a reference point.</p>
      <p>The third one, Absolute, is the object that has as a reference point its parent, this only happens when its parent has a position other than 'static'. If its parent is set to static it will go one level higher to relate to its parent's parent. If no parent object exists that is set to something other than 'static', the element will use the '<html>' element as its parent. Absolute elements can be set anywhere in the page and other object will not interact with them, this allows them to overlap other elements.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, Fixed elements are set relative to the browser window, this will make them sit in one place no matter if you scroll up or down the page (...add banners, anyone?). This elements do not interact with other elements and they can also overlap other elements.</p>
      <p>Hopefully this has helped you understand better how positioning works in CSS and HTML. Enjoy designing your next projects!</p>
