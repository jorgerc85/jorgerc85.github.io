      <h2>Conflict</h2>
      <h4>November, 9th of 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>Conflicts are bad, no one wants to have conflicts (or at least no one should, right?) but if there is a positive side to conflicts it is that they constantly remind us that we are not the only person in the world and that not everyone thinks and feels the same way we do.</p>
      <p>I'm not trying to say that conflicts are good, I'm just trying to say that conflicts are neither good nor bad, they just are. Conflicts just happen, whether because someone creates them with their actions or because we have different and conflicting ways of facing problems.</p>
      <p>What makes the difference in conflicts is how we face them, how we handle them. This is where we can turn conflicts into something good or bad. If we know how to handle the situation and communicate in the correct way, we might be able to get to a positive outcome.</p>
      <p>I'm not a conflictive person by nature, I don't trigger a lot of bad reactions from people and I tend to be as patient as I can with others. But that is not a conflict-proof vest.</p>
      <p>I've had a fair amount of conflicts, the most recent I can remember at work, because a colleague and I were put in an uncomfortable situation. We had to share some equipment, and because we both were treating outpatients, we had appointments that required we both had the same equipment available at the same times and in different locations of the hospital.</p>
      <p>What we should have done in that situation was to team up and make sure the hospital provided us with the equipment we required. What we did instead was to start an argument about who needed the equipment the most. This clearly didn't help. I felt that she treated me in a very condescending way and that made me mad. I pointed out that we were on the floor that I was appointed to originally and that that equipment belonged to my floor. I ended up walking away with the equipment and we both felt frustrated about the whole situation.</p>
      <p>That wasn't the best thing I could have done at that point but in a way it forced us to stop arguing and cool down. A couple of hours later we saw each other and we were a lot more calm and we did what we should have done in the very beginning, we talked to our supervisor and let him know we needed a solution to this problem.</p>
      <p>As a lesson from this experience I would say that when you see yourself in a conflicting situation you should take one step back and try to find the origin of the situation. Sometimes the conflict is not caused by the person you are in conflict with, sometimes you are both in the same boat and working together is the only way to get out!</p>
