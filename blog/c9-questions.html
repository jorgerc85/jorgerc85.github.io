      <h2>Questions - Sometimes it's a matter of context</h2>
      <h4>November, 16th of 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>This week's topic is questions, what defines a good question? How do you make sure that your question is going to be useful and it will get you to the answer that you're looking for? I'll talk about my experience with questions and see if we can draw a few conclusions from there.</p>
      <p>Based on my experience I would say that one of the most important elements to be aware of when asking a question is the context. Context can define how successful a question will be in more than one level. The context in which you ask a question and how you contextualize your question before asking are key. You have to make sure you're asking the correct audience and you also have to make sure to introduce the topic so that people know what you're talking about.</p>
      <p>In my experience I have had this problem many times. I will be thinking about something and without introducing the subject to other people I ask them a question that surprises them. What normally happens is that I will have to explain where my question came from and just after that I'll get an answer.</p>
      <p>Once you have the context for your question it will be much easier for people to answer it. A question with good content but in the wrong context will probably be unsuccessful.</p>
