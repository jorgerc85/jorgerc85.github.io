      <h2>Thinking Style - How do I roll?</h2>
      <h4>October 5th, 2014 by Jorge Rubio C.</h4>
      <p>
        To think about the way I think has been very interesting. Analyzing how I process information, I've come to realize what strategies I use when facing a problem, most of them are part of an automatic process, I don't think about them consciously and I use them as naturally as I get dressed.<br><br>I'm mostly an abstract random thinker, this means I work better in environments where I can participate in group activities with people with whom I have good relationships, I don't need very detailed sets of instructions and being in a restrictive environment or having dictatorial or authoritative partners will go against my performance. Do you want to know about tour thinking style? Go <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">here</a>!<br><br>Based on this, my experience at DBC can be greatly improved if I do my best at keeping good relationships with other boots, working in groups and trying to set a degree of freedom in my task. From what I've researched about DBC I think that the learning environment there has space for this to happen and it's up to all boots to set how everything evolves during our time there.<br><br>As time has passed and we continue going through Phase 0, I've been able to see that the greatest problems I've had come from the way I manage my time, my thinking style seems to be something I can deal with but the way I organize my time, or not, is the main issue I've had to deal with. I've been improving and I've set enough time apart to complete all challenges but I have to get better at time boxing because I keep on losing track of time when trying to complete a given task.<br><br>I am certain that I can change my methods and that I can learn how to manage my time in a much better way. I believe that one of the most important things I will learn during my time at DBC will be related to improving the way I think, learn and work. Learning this will benefit me in ways that will go far beyond programming, they will change the way I live.
