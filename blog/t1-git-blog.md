# Version Control, git and GitHub
#### Killer combination
#### September 19th, 2014

Version control is a systematic approach to software development, it can be applied to many types of projects but we will be focus on software development in this post. It works by making "checkpoints" that store a snapshot of our code at a given state, this allows us to keep track of our progress and gives us backup copies of our code in case something goes wrong. If used correctly, version control will be really helpful when trying to add a new feature to our code or tracking down a bug by checking back to see where it appeared and what piece of code made it appear. But how do you keep track of all those changes? Should you make copies of your code over and over again on your computer and make sure you identify all the changes made to it and the date when they were made? Sounds really time consuming and boring, right? Luckily there is a system that can help you do this really easily, [git](http://www.git-scm.com/).

Git is a system that will simplify version control for everyone. It has a set of "tools", or commands, that will compare your code to the last saved "checkpoint", or commit, you submited. It will also let you know when, and what, changes were made to any of your files. For example, if you add a new file to your project, git will notice ir and make sure you add it to your next commit! Once you are satisfied with the changes you have made, git will help you submit (commit) those changes and store your new version. This new checkpoint will be recorded and you will be able to identify it in the future if you ever need to. Sounds great right? So what if your computer explodes or gets stolen and with it all your code is lost? Don't worry, there is another system that will help you keep all your code safe and organized, [GitHub](http://www.github.com/).

GitHub is an online platform dedicated to storing and organizing repositories (repositories are copies of your code that are stored somewhere, they can be in your computer or online). GitHub uses git to do this, making it really powerful and simple. But that's not everything, GitHub is also a social platform dedicated to developers, this platform allows you to share your code with others and work with them on different projects. One more benefit? You can also use it to host you working project and show it to others, yup, free hosting. You love with GitHub already, don't you? We all do.

So there you have it, if you want a great and simple way of implementing version control on your new project, you should consider git and GitHub as your new best friends. They will make your life so much easier and you will never regret using them.

If you want to learn more about git there are some great tutorials out there, this is one I really liked: [tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) will teach you how to get started. Another place to look for information is [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-other-good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github), lots of info and resources.
